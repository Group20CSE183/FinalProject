First make sure to copy the repo link in terminal using 

```
git clone [repository link] [name of folder]
``` 

Go into the repo 

```
cd [name of folder]
```

and then check the output when you type 

``` 
git status 
```

here, it should say you are on the main branch and that everything is up to date. 

When you make changes and want to send to the project

```
git add *
git commit -m [commit message]
git push 
```

When you want to update your project to what is in the server

#### please note: you want to update your local repo every single time before making changes to it 

```
git pull
```
